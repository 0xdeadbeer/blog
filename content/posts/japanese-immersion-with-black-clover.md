Today I wanted to share my language learning experience of Black Clover. If
you are a fellow learner of the Japanese language and would like to hear some
feedback on this anime, this is the post for you.

I should point out that this is my first anime I ever fully watched with
Japanese subtitles. And so, big thanks to
[Asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer) and
[Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) for making this possible.
Splendid tools for sentence mining. 

If you do not know what they are, in short:
 - Yomichan is an extension which allows you to highlight Japanese words and
   show you their dictionary translations (alongside also provides amazing
   shortcuts for adding the word directly into Anki). 
 - Asbplayer is an extension which allows you to insert custom subtitle files
   into a webplayer (also provides handy shortcuts for automatically inserting
   audio/screenshots into Anki cards)

Not only was watching anime with subtitles suddenly much easier, I could
finally do real sentence mining with Anki and extract all the new words I
wanted with the shortcuts that the two extensions provided.

The whole experience was super fun and engaging enough to make me say "oh come
on, one more episode. \*click\*" (this is especially true because at some point
I even started getting the jokes) 

With all this said, it is totally possible that not everybody will enjoy the
anime the same way as I did. Given the preferences, knowledge difference, etc.
that we might have. But overall I recommend this anime to anybody who feels
that they are at least N4 or better. 

Now, what did I get from this anime?
 - Roughly 200-300 new words
 - Listening and reading skills improved a lot
 - Fun
