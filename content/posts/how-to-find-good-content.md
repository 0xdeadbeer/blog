These days finding good content on the internet is a real challenge. A lot of
the times I find myself staring at the monitor wondering what I should search
for, just to find that juicy content that goes into the detail of how something
works, and also does not annoy me with advertisements, newsletters, and the
like.

The original idea for the internet was really simple, a place for folks to
share, store, and find information. It was no more than static websites serving
HTML and CSS. Now that we have big tech tracking us on practically every corner
of the Internet, it is really difficult to find a clean resource you could say.
Search algorithms prefer clicks, revenue, advertisements, and beauty over
simplistic but gold content.

If you are a fellow searching for structured content and want answers RIGHT NOW
rather than in the next 10 minutes, here is what you have to know. Unless you
are a person with serious mental diseases, the following applies to you. Your
brain is made to be flexible, to adapt to new environments. Whether they are
filled with Netflix & Chill, reading books, doing fun activities, interacting
with people, or anything else. And your brain may well have a favorite learning
style, but that does not mean that you should limit yourself to just that
learning style. In fact, you have to challenge your brain to step out of its
comfort zone and learn, think, adapt, and consider. This is why I think
learning styles are nothing more than temporary classification of how your
brain is preferenced to devour information from the outside world.

I only realized this after coming into IT, at the beginning I thought that
learning was going to be as simple as a watch & learn process. Well, after 5
years of being into IT, I can safely say that I was wrong. Most learning
requires the will to read, explore, dig deeper, and most importantly..
experiment!

If this seems new to you, or even strange, know that it will show up sooner or
later in your career and the sooner you start experimenting, the easier and
more fun it will be! So why not start today? Get yourself a damn book, go read
some research papers online, share, learn, adapt, wonder, and grow.

I wll be leaving you with some good resources that I accumulated over the last
year.
