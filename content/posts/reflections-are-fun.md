Honestly, I have no idea if I am going to come off as a creep by posing this,
but I think that reflections are ~~fun~~ scary!

I am not sure how many people are aware of this, but I am going to share it
anyway because it is a thing I kindof like doing while being bored. One day, I
was on the Internet seeing what new things I can learn and explore. I was
getting bored. And suddenly I see an article titled ["Glass Reflections in
Pictures + OSINT = More Accurate
Location](https://ioactive.com/glass-reflections-in-pictures-osint-more-accurate-location/).
Now that, my friend, is something to fill my boredom with.

I instantly take a look at it and next thing I know I am amazed by it.
Reflections are just so cool! To be fair, I think I have been using reflections
way before that day even, but this article taught me something new. I have to
pay close attention as well. Not just with pictures, but also real life!

Some great examples of what I am talking about:
 - The bus (at this point literally engineered to stalk others lol. Look out
   the window and you can see the phone of the person that is right in front of
   you. 
 - My computer whose left side is covered with glass. If you come in my room,
   you may catch a frame or two of my monitors because of the reflections from
   the monitor to the glass of my computer to your eyes.
 - Eyeglasses (I think there was even a study where OSINT experts tried to
   recover X% of the user's screen by just looking at the reflection in their
   glasses though a video call - was not able to find it unfortunately, but I
   remember the percentage was super high in some example rooms)
