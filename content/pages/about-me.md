I am Kevin J. I am originally from Slovenia and I have a strong passion for
programming, cyber security, data protection, languages, and sometimes reading.
I study Japanese (or at least I like to think so). I deeply care about software
freedom and so I primarily like to deal with free and open-source software
solutions. Many of my ideas and goals come from my love towards space. I cannot
stop dreaming about it.
