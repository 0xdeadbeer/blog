Hello dear visitor! My name is Kevin. I'm from Slovenia and I have a strong passion for reading, programming, cyber security, languages, and much more! 

Over the last couple of years I've been investing a lot of time into Linux, server management, discovering new fields of study (astronomy, math, physics, psychology, ...), and learning languages. The passion for language learning started in 2020 (summer) when I started listening to Russian music. And that's where I realized "Wait I can try learning this language! Oh freak this will be so cool!!". After 2 years that slowly transitioned into Japanese, which is what I'm still learning. My goal is to reach N2-N1 one day. 

Here's a meme for you to keep that smile up!
